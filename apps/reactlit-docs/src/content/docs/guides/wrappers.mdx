title: Wrappers
---

You might encounter use cases that make Reactlit feel limiting when it comes to the heirarchical nature
of UI. The fact that the render is a flat list of elements can make it hard to build even moderately complex
interfaces.

To solve this, Reactlit provides a way to wrap elements in custom components. These wrappers can be used to
apply styles and add structure to your UI.

Any `display` or `view` call actually allows a varidic number of arguments. Penultmate arguments are considered wrappers
and will automatically `wrap` their successors. The structure can look a bit unusual coming from standard React, but
it does allow for a lot of flexibility in a very succinct format.

Wrappers come in two flavors.

1. They can be static React elements with their children omitted:

```tsx
const name = view(
  'name',
  <div style={{ padding: '2rem' }} />,
  Inputs.Text({ placeholder: 'Enter your name' })
);
display(
  <div style={{ padding: '2rem' }} />,
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
);
```

2. They can react components of type `WrapperComponent`.

define the component builder. This is a function that creates the wrapper component
you want to use.

```tsx
export const Label = (label: string) => {
  const LabelComponent: WrapperComponent = ({ children, stateKey }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <label htmlFor={stateKey}>{label}</label>
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  };
  return LabelComponent;
};
```

use the component:

```tsx
const name = view(
  'name',
  Label('Name'),
  Inputs.Text({ placeholder: 'Enter your name' })
);
```

This makes views and displays much more composable allowing you to build
custom interfaces without a lot of boilerplate.
